# Hydrogen Atom Quantum State Transitions Visualization

This Python script visualizes quantum state transitions of a hydrogen atom using Python's scientific libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. It computes and animates transitions between various quantum states of a hydrogen atom by calculating the probability density of the electron's position in space for a given set of quantum numbers. The visualization showcases the beauty and complexity of quantum mechanical behaviors in atomic systems.

## Features

- Calculation of wave functions for hydrogen atom quantum states using spherical harmonics and generalized Laguerre polynomials.
- Visualization of quantum state transitions through smooth interpolations between states.
- Generation of animations showcasing the dynamic evolution of electron probability densities across different quantum states.
- Utilization of ease-in-out sine function for smooth transition animations between states.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need a Python environment with the following packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

These packages can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Usage
1. Ensure you have all the required packages installed in your Python environment.
2. Place the script in your project directory.
3. Run the script using Python:
```bash
python hydrogen_atom_visualization.py
```
The script will generate an MP4 video file named hydrogen_atom_transitions_smooth_ease.mp4 in the directory, illustrating the transitions between the quantum states of a hydrogen atom.

## How It Works
- The script defines key functions for computing the wave function of a hydrogen atom's electron for given quantum numbers (n, l, m) and coordinates (r, theta, phi).
- It then defines a function to calculate superpositions of these wave functions, allowing for the visualization of transitions between states.
- The animation iterates through predefined state transitions, smoothly interpolating between them to visualize the electron's probability density changes.
- The visualization is performed in a 2D plane for simplicity, focusing on the x and z coordinates by integrating out the y dimension.
## Visualization Details
- The script uses a contour plot to visualize the probability density on a 2D plane.
- Probability densities are normalized and displayed using a logarithmic scale to enhance visibility across orders of magnitude.
- Transitions between states are animated using a smooth ease-in-out sine function, providing a visually appealing transition effect.
